               <h2>Quirkless Wonder</h2>
               <p>
                  I was born quirkless in a society full of extraordinary people.  All I ever wanted was to become a hero and save people.  I was about to enter High School, and it was my dream to train to become a hero at one of the most prestigious schools in Japan: U.A. High.

               <h2>My Hero</h2>
               <p>
                  When I met All Might, everything changed.  He saw me for who I was, and knew that if given the opportunity, one day I would save the world.

               <h2>One for All</h2>
               <p>
                  All Might deemed my spirit worthy of carrying on his legacy and his quirk, One for All.  His power was one passed down through generations, and it became stronger and more refined with each passing vessel.  He took on the burden of training me to become the world's next Symbol of Peace.

               <p>
                  After months of intense training with All Might around the clock, the time had come to partake in the U.A. High Entrance Exam.

               <p>
                  I passed! All my hard work had payed off.  But my journey had only just begun.  With new friends by my side, I set off to become the world's greatest hero.
